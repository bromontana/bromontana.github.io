## Personal Statement
I am an active student at Florida Polytechnic University and I want to learn enough to
leave a lasting legacy; A legacy which will positively impact anyone in the future
who should decide to follow a path similar to mine.
The hacking community is where I have decided I can best influence my community, and there
is a legitimate reason for that.

The community of people who hack are among the most passionate people I have ever met
(irregardless of age or affluence), and I can only hope that one day I can empower as
many truly passionate people as possible.
